# EcoFootprint Calculator

## üå≥ Understand Your Environmental Impact

The **EcoFootprint Calculator** is a simple, intuitive web application designed to help individuals understand how their daily activities contribute to carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions. By inputting details about your travel, electricity consumption (specifically AC usage), and meat consumption, the program calculates your estimated weekly carbon footprint and provides personalized, actionable tips to help you reduce your environmental impact.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, aesthetic design with a calming color palette for a pleasant user experience.
* **Simple Input:** Easily enter details on bike kilometers, car kilometers, AC hours, and meat meals per week.
* **Instant Calculation:** Get your estimated weekly CO‚ÇÇ footprint in kilograms instantly.
* **Dynamic Assessment:** Receive a clear assessment (e.g., "Fantastic!", "Good Effort!", "Time for Action!") based on your calculated footprint.
* **Personalized Tips:** Get eco-friendly suggestions tailored to your highest contributing activities, helping you make targeted changes.
* **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## üí° How It Works

The calculator uses predefined emission factors to estimate the CO‚ÇÇ equivalent for each activity:

* **Biking:** Considered a zero-emission activity for direct CO‚ÇÇ output.
* **Car Driving:** Multiplies kilometers driven by an average CO‚ÇÇ emission factor for typical passenger vehicles.
* **AC Usage:** Estimates CO‚ÇÇ based on hours of use, accounting for electricity consumption and grid carbon intensity.
* **Meat Meals:** Uses a general factor to represent the higher carbon footprint associated with meat production (due to land use, methane emissions from livestock, etc.).

**Example Emissions (Illustrative Averages):**
* **Car:** ~0.17 kg CO‚ÇÇ per km
* **AC:** ~0.5 kg CO‚ÇÇ per hour
* **Meat Meal:** ~2.0 kg CO‚ÇÇ per meal

**Note:** These factors are simplified averages. Actual emissions can vary based on specific vehicle efficiency, regional electricity sources, and types of meat consumed.
